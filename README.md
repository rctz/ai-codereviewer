# AI Code Reviewer

AI Code Reviewer is a GitHub Action that leverages multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to provide intelligent feedback and suggestions on your pull requests. This powerful tool helps improve code quality and saves developers time by automating the code review process.

## Features

- Supports multiple AI providers:
  - OpenAI (ChatGPT)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Google (Gemini)
- Provides intelligent comments and suggestions for improving your code
- Reviews only new changes in PR updates
- Filters out files that match specified exclude patterns
- Easy to set up and integrate into your GitHub workflow

## Setup

1. Choose your preferred AI provider and get an API key:
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
   - [Google AI](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Add the API key as a GitHub Secret in your repository:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude
   - `GOOGLE_AI_KEY` for Google Gemini

3. Create `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions: write-all

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: AI Code Review
        uses: your-username/ai-code-reviewer@main
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
          # Choose your AI provider and key
          AI_PROVIDER: "openai" # or "anthropic" or "google"
          AI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          AI_MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini"
          AI_TEMPERATURE: 0.3 # 0 to 1 - higher values = more creativity and variance

          # Optional configurations

          MAX_COMMENTS: 10 # 0 to disable
          PROJECT_CONTEXT: "This is a Node.js TypeScript project"
          CONTEXT_FILES: "package.json,README.md"
          EXCLUDE_PATTERNS: "**/*.lock,**/*.json,**/*.md"
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build TypeScript files
yarn build

# Run unit tests
yarn test

# Package for distribution
yarn package

# Generate test PR payload (for e2e testing)
yarn generate-pr-payload <owner> <repo> <pr_number>

# Run end-to-end tests
yarn test:e2e <owner> <repo> <pr_number>
```

### Testing Locally

To test the action locally:

1. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
AI_PROVIDER=openai  # or anthropic, google
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
AI_MODEL=your_preferred_model
```

2. Generate a test PR payload:
```bash
yarn generate-pr-payload <owner> <repo> 123
```

3. Run the e2e test:
```bash
yarn test:e2e <owner> <repo> 123
```

Note: Make sure you have write access to the repository you're testing with.
